# PodcastSpeed

This app, built with Electron, will speed up an audio file, while maintaining pitch, perfect for increasing speed of a podcast. It uses the ffmpeg binary to do this in the background.

To install, open a terminal in the app directory and run:

```
npm install
```

To run:

```
electron .
```

Currently, the app assumes you do not have ffmpeg installed on your system. The code can easily be modified to use ffmpeg binary already installed on your system. Will update with instructions.
